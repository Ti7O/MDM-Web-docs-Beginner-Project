# MDM-Web-docs-Beginner-Project
This is the MDM web docs Beginner HTML, CSS and Java-script Project. I did take my own twist on the Javascript section where instead of making a image changer I made the whole website transform from a Edge website to a Firefox website

If you didin't understand here is a live demo: https://mdm-webdocs-beginnerproject-demo.netlify.app/
To activate it you click on the "Welcome to Microsoft Edge Header"
